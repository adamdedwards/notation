He seems to have a logical matrix in his book and also, need to create a catalog of the notations he has employed in his other works such as many valued logics.

** Randolf Diagrams

[[./img/randolf.png]]

Randolf Diagrams were used to notate Boolean operations in a 2 by 2 grid. This can be extended to more than one truth values.

[[./img/randolf-multiple-truth-values.png]]

These might have precursors in X-frame notation of Peirce in “A Proposed Logical Notation (1903)”. Detail from this [[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1108/1108.2429.pdf][paper]]

** Karnaugh Maps
Karnaugh maps are used to notate Boolean algebra. This is an improvement upon Veitch Chart which is a rediscovery of Marquand Diagrams introduced by Allan Marquand.
